					On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 50% based on 139 reviews, with an average rating
					of 5.9/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "The Greatest Showman tries hard to dazzle the
					audience with a Barnum-style sense of wonder -- but at the expense of its complex subject's far more
					intriguing real-life story." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 48 out of 100,
					based on 43 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the
					film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.

					Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a positive review, writing, "The Greatest Showman is a
					concoction, the kind of film where all the pieces click into place, yet at an hour and 45 minutes it
					flies by, and the link it draws between P.T. Barnum and the spirit of today is more than hype." Richard
					Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3/4 stars, saying, "With all that corn and cheese and
					old-timey sentiment, The Greatest Showman ends up scoring some very timely social arguments. P.T. Barnum
					himself would have approved the dramatic sleight of hand." Steve Persall of Tampa Bay Times gave the
					film an 'A', and said, "The Greatest Showman is the feel-good movie the holiday season needs." William
					Bibbiani of IGN gave The Greatest Showman a score of 7.9/10, and called the film, "wildly entertaining."

					Britton Peele of The Dallas Morning News said, "The story is interesting and the beats are well-acted,
					but it's the musical numbers that make The Greatest Showman." Rebecca Pahle of Film Journal called the
					film "splashy, fun, crowd-pleasing entertainment." Hugh Armitage of Digital Spy said, "The Greatest
					Showman is a broad and solid crowd-pleaser. An undemanding spectacle for all the family." Alan Jones of
					Radio Times called it "A joyously uplifting potpourri of visual resplendence, stylish choreography and
					solid gold magic, one engineered to approximate the lavish spectacle the movie musical once offered."

					Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com gave it 3.5/4, stating 'The Greatest Showman is an unabashed piece of
					pure entertainment punctuated by memorable songs.' Douglas Davidson of CLTure called the film, "An
					undeniable spectacle with an infectious soundtrack, a movie that dazzles and delights." James
					Berardinelli of ReelViews gave a 3/4 score and said, 'The film has show-stopping well-choreographed
					numbers with catchy tunes.' Calvin Wilson of St. Louis Post-Dispatch called the film 'highly enjoyable'

					Conversely, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film a negative review, criticizing the
					songs and characters and saying "There’s idiotic, and there’s magnificent, but The Greatest Showman is
					that special thing that happens sometimes. It’s magnificently idiotic. It’s an awful mess, but it’s
					flashy. The temptation is to cover your face and watch it through your fingers because it’s so earnest
					and embarrassing and misguided — and yet it’s well-made." In a negative review for The Hollywood
					Reporter, David Rooney wrote "This ersatz portrait of American big-top tent impresario P.T. Barnum is
					all smoke and mirrors, no substance. It hammers pedestrian themes of family, friendship, and inclusivity
					while neglecting the fundaments of character and story."

					Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, saying, "How do you cast a
					virtuoso Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum, spare no expense in production values, add a score by Oscar and
					Tony winners Ben Pasek and Justin Paul and still end up with the shrill blast of nothing that is The
					Greatest Showman? Ask the first-time director Michael Gracey, who cut his teeth on commercials and music
					videos without ever mastering the crucial knack of building snippets of musical comedy and drama into a
					satisfying whole." Justin Chang of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film's failures "are rooted in
					something deeper: a dispiriting lack of faith in the audience’s intelligence, and a dawning awareness of
					its own aesthetic hypocrisy. You’ve rarely seen a more straight-laced musical about the joys of letting
					your freak flag fly."
